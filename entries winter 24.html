<br>
lifeless feet in early morning, come to me with wild eyes.
<br>
ask small favour, tell me i saved your life.
<br>
the love slides back up my throat, 
<br>
smother my unnatural desires in industrial noise. 
<br>
i will retire my metals till april comes around again, 
<br>
allow moths into my room and watch them flicker
<br>
and fade.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">ignore the hole i've dug again 
        <br>
        it's only for the evening
        <br>
        i never wanted you to see that much
        <br>
        of the bodies down there beneath me 
        <br>
        you are the only one i've known
        <br>
        who broke the world so quietly
        <br>
        and turned your perfect hands to me
